turn your health goals into a reality! this app creates specific recipes for you based on your health goals 
# README
App that aligns users health goals with their eating habits. 

The app gives you recipe recommendations for each meal based on the time of day(For example, breakfast options between the times of 6am-11am). Users can also search recipes and explore different cuisines. Moreover, the app calculates your daily calorie and macro(fat, carbs, and protein) intake based on your personal information. So when you add a recipe to your meals for the day it will inform you how much of your daily calories and macro intake that accounts for. Users can view a recipeâ€™s details view that has the ingredients, nutrition facts, and directions. Additionally, users can edit their profile picture, health goals, and grocery list. I learned so much while making this app and am so excited to share it with you all!
